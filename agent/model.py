"""
THE MODEL TOOL: the readmission model trained by the federation in Week 6.

models/federated_readmission.json holds what the coordinator published after
the Lab 7 clean run: 24 weights, one bias, the feature names, the human-unit
mean and sd agreed by the consortium, and the model card facts (accuracy on
the neutral test set, per hospital). No patient record is in that file.

The agent never trains anything. It USES this model as one tool among several.
